#EDA Requirements (A few requirements about your EDA are below:
#∗ You should pull data from at least two separate calls to your API functions
#∗ You should create some contingency tables
#∗ You should create numerical summaries for some quantitative variables at each setting of some
#of your categorical variables
#∗ You should create at least five plots utilizing coloring, grouping, etc. All plots should have
#nice labels and titles.
#· At least one plot that you create should be a plot that we didn’t cover in class (say a
#heatmap or something like that - lots of good examples to consider here https://exts.
